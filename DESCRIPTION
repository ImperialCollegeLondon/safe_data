Description: The SAFE Project is a large scale ecological experiment
    in Malaysian Borneo that explores the impact of habitat fragmentation
    and conversion on ecosystem function and services. Data collected at
    the SAFE Project is made available under a common format through the
    Zenodo data repository and this package makes it easy to discover and
    load that data into R.
