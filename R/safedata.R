#' safedata: Finding and using data from the SAFE Project.
#'
#' 
#' The SAFE Project is one of the largest ecological experiments in the world.
#' We are studying how biodiversity and ecosystem function change as forests are 
#' modified by human activities. As well as studying the change, we also
#' explore whether preserving sections of forest within modified landscapes
#' and around waterways can protect biodiversity and ecosystem function, 
#' and how much protection is needed to be effective.
#' 
#' The project is a multinational collaboration that has generated a wide range
#' of research data. We archive and document this data using the Zenodo file
#' repository and maintain spatial, taxonomic and other indices to support data
#' discovery and reuse. This package provides a range of tools to make it easier
#' to find and analyse our research data outputs.
